## Push Notification

Push Notifications are **instant in-app alerts** sent directly to bidders during a live auction. These notifications help deliver important updates in real time.

### How It Works

- The auctioneer triggers a push notification.
- The bidder instantly receives a popup that includes:
  - **Title** – short heading for the notification
  - **Message** – detailed information or instruction
- The popup appears immediately on the bidder’s UI without requiring a page refresh.
