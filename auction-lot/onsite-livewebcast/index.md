## Bidding

We support two types of bidders during an auction: **Internet Bidders** and **Floor Bidders**.

### 1. Internet Bidders

- Internet bidders can place bids directly through the **public website**.
- They participate in real time and submit bids using the **online bidding interface**.

### 2. Floor Bidders

- Floor bidders are physically present at the auction venue.
- Their bids are **entered manually by the auctioneer** on their behalf.
- Floor bidders can bid using the **standard auction increments** or provide a **custom bid amount** to the auctioneer.
